This is the implementation of our [submission](https://dcase.community/documents/challenge2023/technical_reports/DCASE2023_Moummad_IMT_t5.pdf) for the challenge DCASE 2023 task 5.\
We invite you to take a look at the [workshop paper version](https://dcase.community/documents/workshop2023/proceedings/DCASE2023Workshop_Moummad_63.pdf) for more details and ablation studies.\
We ranked 2nd in the challenge. For more informations about the challenge results, [click here](https://dcase.community/challenge2023/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection-results) 

Our approach consists in :
<ul>
<li>Training a feature extractor on the training set</li>
<li>Training a linear classifier on each audio of the validation set</li>
</ul>

Firstly, we create the spectrograms of the training set :\
```create_train.py``` : with argument ```--traindir``` for the folder containing the training datasets.

To train the feature extractor :\
```train.py``` : with arguments ```--traindir``` (the same as above), ```--device``` the device to train on, and others concerning training and data augmentation hyperparameters that can be found in ```args.py``` with default values that we used.

To validate the learned feature extractor using 5-shots :\
```evaluate.py``` : with arguments ```--valdir``` for the folder containing the validation datasets, and others concerning hyperparameters that can also be found in ```args.py```. Add :\
For submission 1 :\
```--ft 0 --ftlr 0.01 --ftepochs 20 --method ce --adam```\
For submission 2 :\
```--ft 1 --ftlr 0.001 --ftepochs 40 --method ce --adam```\
For submission 3 :\
```--ft 2 --ftlr 0.001 --ftepochs 40 --method ce --adam```\
For submission 4 :\
```--ft 3 --ftlr 0.001 --ftepochs 40 --method ce --adam```

To get the scores :\
```evaluation_metrics/evaluation.py``` : with arguments ```-pred_file``` for the predictions csv file created by ```evaluate.py``` (the file is in : traindir/../../outputs/eval.csv'), ```-ref_files``` for the path of validation datasets, and ```-save_path``` for the folder where to save the scores json file

We are thankful for the challenge baseline code that helped us make this repository : https://github.com/ilyassmoummad/dcase-few-shot-bioacoustic/tree/main

### Bonus
Take a look at our newer work accepted at ICASSP 2024 where we improve the pre-training loss as well as the inference strategy (which is more stable) : https://github.com/ilyassmoummad/RCL_FS_BSED
